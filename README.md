# Sri Sathya Sai Echos

Drawing inspiration from Sri Sathya Sai Baba's discourses and teachings, we embarked on a project to develop an interactive chatbot that incorporates cutting-edge technologies. With the guidance and support of PVSS Prakash, we achieved remarkable milestones:

- **Sri Sathya Sai Baba's Teachings Integration**: We meticulously integrated the wisdom and insights from Sri Sathya Sai Baba's discourses and books into the chatbot's knowledge base, ensuring that users receive authentic and meaningful responses aligned with his teachings.
- **Retrieval Augmentation (RAG) Framework**: Leveraging the advanced capabilities of Retrieval Augmentation (RAG) using Langchain and VectorDB, our chatbot can efficiently retrieve relevant information and provide contextually accurate answers to user queries, enhancing the conversational experience.
- **Llama-2 Integration**: By integrating Llama-2, a state-of-the-art language model, we enhanced the chatbot's natural language understanding and response generation capabilities, enabling more fluid and human-like interactions.
- **User Engagement and Satisfaction**: The combined efforts of integrating Sri Sathya Sai Baba's teachings, RAG framework, and Llama-2 resulted in an interactive chatbot that not only provides informative responses but also fosters a deeper connection with users, leading to higher engagement and
satisfaction levels.
